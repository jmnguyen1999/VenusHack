            <h3>Data Science</h3>
            <p>
            Those who work in data science like to solve problems through storytelling. <br>
            They follow business trends, objectively analyze real-world problems and their <br>
            solutions, and are open-minded when it comes to choosing an approach. <br>
            Data scientists are skilled in critical thinking and communication, and often <br>
            work with machine learning applications and mathematical algorithms. They also <br>
            work solo, until they need to present their findings to <br>
            company executives and key stakeholders.<br>
