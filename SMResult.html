            <h3>Systems Management</h3>
            <p>
            Systems managers' main duty is overseeing IT departments! <br>
            Their duties lie in managing an organization's networks and/or databases, <br>
            supporting employees through new systems, and often implementing security procedures. <br>
            Systems managers may work in both broad or close-knitted teams depending on department <br>
            and organization size! They often require knowledge of networks, information security <br>
            standards, operating systems, and hardware. People who are System managers also tend<br>
            to think very analytically, and business-focused in order to organize in lead in <br>
            a powerful way!
